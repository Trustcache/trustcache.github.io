I'm Jie Sheng, a Malaysian/Singaporean Secondary 3 student 

In my free time, I enjoy playing maimai, phigros and tinker around with mobile and desktop hardware.

Fun facts about me:

1. I have a teeny weeny business on carousell!
2. I am currently learning
    Circuit Board design 
    and
    hope i don't start a house fire

I fix phones somehow
I'm a living person (believe it or not)
