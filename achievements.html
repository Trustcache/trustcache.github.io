                <ul>
                    <p>I was introduced to jailbreaking my iPhone as I hated how I could not sideload apps. Jailbreaking is the process of achieving
                        root access to one's iPhone. </p>
                    <p>As jailbreaking is extremely powerful, it also allows one to inject code into iOS, more
                        colloquially known as "tweaks". As such, its extremely hard to develop a Jailbreak due to the security that latest iOS has. </p>
                    <p>I'm not talented enough to make tweaks, but heres my jailbroken iPhone!

                    <p>Through my school's Applied Learning Programme, I learnt to use mBot and Arduino and how to
                        programme a robot to complete basic obstacle courses. </p>
                    <p>I coded the mBot to only follow black colored lines, and to turn automatically whenever it
                        detected a wall. </p>

                <ul>
                    <p>I've always been intrigued by apps, and how they're coded for so many devices while maintaining
                        user friendliness. </p>
                    <p>Recently, since the Covid-19 Pandemic started, more and more apps have been released to aid
                        people fare through tough times during lockdown by providing various goods/services (eg.
                        Redmart, Carousell) </p>
                    <p>Hence, I started to search up on what languages mobile apps are coded in, and came across Swift.
                        Swift is the native language used in Apple iPhone applications. </p>
                    <p>I've since learnt some basic Swift from Codecademy and am currently learning SwiftUI through "100
                        Days of Swift(UI)" by Hacking with Swift. </p>

                    <p>Recently, I picked up a new rhythm game known as maimai! It's an arcade rhythm game thats slowly but surely burning a hole in my pocket! Its a fast pace rhythm game that is made up of a touch screen surrounded by 8 buttons. </p>
                    <p>This game requires alot of stamina, which is unique to the game. Only being in this hobby for 2 months, I have gotten exponentially better, rising up to master difficulty and high level songs while at the cost of some money and energy. Shown is my progress in the 2 months of playing! </p>

                    <p>Coding a website for my portfolio seemed like a fun challenge and project, as I have never used
                        HTML or CSS ever before. </p>
                    <p>Challenges that I faced while doing so were numerous, as I did not know how to use flexboxes or
                        CSS while building a website. </p>
                    <p>However, through looking through HTML and CSS tutorials found online, I've gained a much better
                        understanding of how CSS and Javascript can be used to make websites. </p>
                    <p>This website uses the catpuccin color scheme and supports mobile layout, as well as dark and
                        light mode. </p>
